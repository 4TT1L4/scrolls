# Reducers

Scroll Reducers are Map/Reduce algorithms that turn block data into a relevant information to be queried by end-users.

There are several ways to implement reducers in Scrolls:

- [Typescript](./typescript.md): using custom Typescript code to implement the map/reduce logic
- [Rust](./rust.md): using custom Rust code to implement the map/reduce logic
